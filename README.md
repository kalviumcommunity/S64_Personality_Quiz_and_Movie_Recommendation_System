# **Project Title:
Personality Quiz & Movie Recommendation System**

# **Project Overview:**

This project is a Personality Quiz and Movie Recommendation System that allows users to take a personality quiz consisting of 12 questions. Based on their responses, the system generates a movie recommendation tailored to their personality type. The application features a React-based frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, with data stored in MongoDB. The app aims to provide users with a fun, interactive experience while offering personalized recommendations for underrated movies.

# **Key Features:**
- Personality Quiz: A 12-question quiz to assess the user’s personality.
- Movie Recommendation Engine: Suggests an underrated movie based on the user's personality type.
- Database Integration: Stores user quiz results and movie recommendations in MongoDB.
- CRUD Operations: Implements insert, update, and delete operations for managing data.
- User Authentication: Adds users to the database and securely manages passwords.
- Responsive Design: The frontend is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Session Management: Stores the username in session storage for user persistence.
- API Testing: The API is thoroughly tested with Postman to ensure smooth operations.
- Full-Stack Deployment: Both frontend and backend are deployed and accessible via the web.

# **Tech Stack:**

 - Frontend:

1. React: For building the interactive user interface.
2. Vite: To set up the React app quickly with a modern, fast development environment.
3. Axios: For making API requests to the backend.

 - Backend:

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the server.
- Express: Web framework for building the API.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database to store user data and quiz results.
- Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool for MongoDB.
- bcrypt: For password encryption and secure storage.

- Deployment:

1. Frontend: Deployed on Netlify for fast, serverless hosting.
2. Backend: Deployed on Heroku or Render.
3. Database: MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database hosting.

# **Why This Project:**

I chose this project because it combines personality psychology with full-stack web development, allowing me to create an interactive, personalized experience for users. Through this project, I’ve gained hands-on experience with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, learning how to build APIs, manage databases, and deploy full-stack applications. The project also helped me develop important skills in session management, user authentication, and API testing, making it both a fun and valuable learning experience.

This project is not only fun and educational but also demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack application from start to finish, deploying both the frontend and backend to production. It has been a great opportunity to develop my skills in both backend technologies and frontend development, while also focusing on database management and user authentication.
